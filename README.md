# odin-recipes
This is my first assignment within The Odin Project.
I will be testing my newly learned (or refreshed) HTML
skills.

I am going to create a very basic recipe website using only HTML code then commit it to Github.

Key areas to highlight will be different styles of text,
use of links and images, paragraphs and lists.
