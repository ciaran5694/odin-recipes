        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Katsu curry is the most complex dish on this website, so prepare yourself for some Masterchef level shit!</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Katsu curry base</li>
            <li>Chicken schnitzel</li>
            <li>1 Potato</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>1 Carrot</li>
            <li>Steamed rice</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Method</h3></p>
        <p>This recipe assumes you have already cooked your schnitzel and rice. If you haven't go find your own recipe. I am a basic HTML website, not a cooking blog with the authors life story and links to a billion other recipes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop and stir-fry veg for five minutes</li>
            <li>Add water to cover then simmer for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Add katsu base and stir gently and constantly until dissolved</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-3 more minutes</li>
            <li>You can adjust the consistency to make it thinner by adding more water or thicker by reducing based on your preference</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Yum!</p>
